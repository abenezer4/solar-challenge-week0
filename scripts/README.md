# Scripts Folder

This folder is reserved for automation or data-fetching scripts.

Example use cases:
- Fetching solar data from APIs or remote sources
- Preprocessing or cleaning raw datasets
- Batch-running analysis notebooks

Currently, data is loaded from `/data` (pre-cleaned CSVs), 
but this structure allows easy integration with live data sources later.
